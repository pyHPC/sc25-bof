## Abstract

## Long description 
(500-word maximum) clearly stating goal(s), topic, relevance to the expected HPC audience, and the expected outcome; and

Python is the world's most popular programming language. Python on HPC systems has it's own special challenges. 

There are many standards or PEPs (Python enhancement proposals) in flight that will affect the HPC community, but largely there is zero overlap with the Python Steering Committee 

These standards include:
- Packaging standards are evolving to accommodate system libraries,
- just-in-time compilation systems are being developed at the bytecode level of the language,
-  asynchronous threading primatives are being added to the language.

These recent changes in the language should have representation from the Supercomputing community, we are organizing leaders in the Core Python teams to take feedback from HPC practicitioners at this BOF.
