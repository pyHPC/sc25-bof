## Abstract 
(100-word maximum)


## Long description 
(500-word maximum) clearly stating goal(s), topic, relevance to the expected HPC audience, and the expected outcome; and

Python is the world's most popular programming language. Python on HPC systems has it's own special challenges. These challenges often prevent new comers to HPC from fully realizing the potential of supercomputers.

There are many standards or PEPs (Python enhancement proposals) in flight that will affect the HPC community, but largely there is zero overlap with the Python Steering Committee 

These standards include:
- Packaging standards are evolving to accommodate system libraries,
- just-in-time compilation systems are being developed at the bytecode level of the language,
- asynchronous threading primatives are being added to the language.

These recent changes in the language should have representation from the Supercomputing community, we are organizing leaders in the Core Python teams to take feedback from HPC practicitioners at this BOF.

Attendee will get an understanding of the the newest standards in the Python language, why they may or may not want to use them, and conections to other Python users in the field who they can network with to find common ground for finding solutions.


## Session format information, 
including a description (150-word maximum) of how you plan to organize the BoF session.

The first part of the BOF Session will be 10 minutes setting up context for attendees. We will have a speaker with one slide setting up each new standard. Speakers identified include Barry Warsaw, Micheal Droetboom, and Carol Willing.

The second part will be a facilitated discussion giving the audience the opportunity to discuss how these standards impact their workflow.

Remote participants will be able to join via notes on HackMD and the pyHPC Discord server.
